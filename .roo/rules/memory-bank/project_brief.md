# I. Project Overview

## A. Introduction and Vision

This document outlines the project brief for a single-player simulation game focused on the strategic management of a company developing Artificial Superintelligence (ASI). The player navigates the complex ethical, technological, and societal challenges inherent in this pursuit. This brief is tailored for a solo indie game developer utilizing the Godot Engine, emphasizing realistic scoping, efficient development strategies, and a phased prototyping approach.

The core vision is to create an engaging and thought-provoking experience where players grapple with the profound implications of ASI development. The game aims to blend company management, technological progression, narrative events, and the unique challenge of guiding an evolving, potentially unpredictable ASI. Success is not merely financial; it involves navigating the delicate balance between innovation, safety, and societal impact.

## B. Game Concept: The Genesis of Superintelligence

This game laces the player at the helm of a pioneering research company on the cusp of creating ASI. The game explores themes of ambition, responsibility, the nature of intelligence, and the potential existential risks and rewards associated with god-like AI. The player's decisions will shape not only their company's fate but also the future of humanity and its relationship with the emergent ASI. The narrative will unfold through a combination of systemic interactions, emergent events, and player choices, offering a branching storyline with multiple potential outcomes.

The central tension revolves around managing the ASI's development. As the ASI evolves, it will unlock new capabilities and present unforeseen challenges, forcing the player to make difficult choices regarding control, alignment, and the ASI's role in the world. The game is not about directly "programming" the ASI but about guiding its development environment, setting research priorities, and responding to its emergent behaviors.

- **Theme:** Plunge players into the ethically fraught, intensely competitive, and darkly satirical world of Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) development and managing development of a company from a fledgling start up to mega corporation. Set in a cyberpunk-like, futuristic world on the brink of huge technological changes. Unique blend of dark satire, existential tension, and psychological horror.
- **Inspirations:** Crusader Kings (character/faction depth), Papers Please (console-based pressure decisions), Game Dev Tycoon (strategic resource/tech management), Black Mirror (satirical tech-dread, philosophical implications).
- **Logline:** "You're building ASI in a Silicon Valley garage. Manage a chaotic startup from nothing to Skynet, navigate ruthless rivals and internal politics, and shape the consciousness of an ASI that could save humanity... or delete it. Just try to clear your browser history before achieving godhood."
- **Target Audience:** Players thriving on complexity, consequence, deep simulation, strategic management, emergent narrative, and thought-provoking sci-fi. Fans of Paradox titles, narrative sims (Cultist Simulator, Suzerain), thematic management (Frostpunk, RimWorld).
- **Satire:** Lampooning tech-bro culture, startup hype, corporate jargon, the absurdity of godlike intelligence via code.
- **Psychological Horror:** Stemming from building a company (potentially exploitative) in a cyberpunk world and ASI's unpredictability, incomprehensible intelligence/malice, ethical compromises, potential for catastrophic failure, and staff mental degradation.
- **Existentialism:** Exploring consciousness, machine ethics, transhumanism, humanity's place.
- **Dark Humour:** Juxtaposition of mundane startup issues with world-ending stakes; ASI's literal interpretations or bizarre emergent quirks (e.g., "Your AI just downloaded the entire philosophy section of Wikipedia and started debating with itself").

## C. Unique Selling Proposition (USP)

Unlike traditional tycoon games, this game offers intricate simulation of ASI research within a world of active, goal-oriented factions subject to emergent narrative events.  
Players manage commercial aspects while controlling nuanced ASI development paths, including societal impacts and risks, creating a fresh strategy/management experience.

Aims to be a highly replayable narrative simulation where player choices dynamically shape the ASI's personality, company destiny, and humanity's future.

## **IV. Project Scope & Development Goals**

Given the complexity of the envisioned game and the solo developer context, a carefully phased approach with a tightly defined Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is essential for success.

### **A. Defining a Realistic MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for a Solo Developer**

The MVP should focus on delivering the core unique experience of the game: managing a company involved in early-stage ASI development within a simplified dynamic world. The goal is to validate that this central loop is engaging and provides a foundation for future expansion.

- **Core MVP Features:**
  1. **Simplified Company Management:**
     - Basic financial model: Income (e.g., one type of contract), Expenses (salaries, one project cost).
     - Resource management: Money and Research Points (RP) only.
     - One active R&D project at a time.
  2. **Rudimentary R&D/Tech Tree:**
     - A small, linear tech tree (5-7 techs) leading to a "Proto-AI" (very early ASI stage).
     - Techs unlock simple bonuses (e.g., +RP generation, faster research) or the next tech.
  3. **Basic Staff System:**
     - Hire 1-2 staff members.
     - One primary skill (e.g., "Research Skill").
     - Basic salary mechanic.
     - No complex needs or morale beyond a simple "Happiness" affecting their research output.
     - Assign staff to the current R&D project.
  4. **Simplified Faction Interaction:**
     - One or two AI factions with very basic goals (e.g., "Wants Money," "Wants Tech").
     - Simple relationship system (e.g., a single numerical value).
     - A few key diplomatic actions: Offer Contract (player to faction for money), Request Tech Access (player to faction, costs relationship points or money).
  5. **Early ASI Representation:**
     - Unlocking the "Proto-AI" tech signifies the ASI's emergence.
     - Basic UI panel showing ASI status (e.g., "Offline," "Learning," "Assisting Research").
     - One or two simple interactions: e.g., "Assign Proto-AI to assist current R&D project" (provides a small RP boost). No complex alignment or risk mechanics yet.
  6. **Minimal Event System:**
     - 2-3 key event types triggered by simple conditions (e.g., "R&D Breakthrough!" on project success, "Low Funds Warning" if money drops below a threshold).
     - Events offer simple choices with clear resource/relationship impacts.
  7. **Basic Player Character Skills:**
     - One or two player skills (e.g., "Negotiation" affecting contract payouts, "Technical Insight" slightly boosting research speed).
     - No complex player stress/well-being system in MVP.
  8. **Weekly Time Progression:** Core turn-based loop.

The MVP must demonstrate the interconnectedness of these core systems: the player manages the company to fund R&D, uses staff to conduct R&D, interacts with factions for resources/opportunities, and begins the journey of ASI development. The primary risk for a solo developer is over-scoping ; thus, the MVP must be ruthlessly streamlined to what is essential to prove the concept.

- **Company Management:** Expand financial modeling (investments, loans, stock market). Introduce marketing and sales mechanics. Add layers to resource management (more resource types, abstracted production chains). Allow for company infrastructure upgrades (offices, labs).
- **Player Character:** Implement the full skill set and progression system. Introduce the stress/burnout mechanics and ways for the player to manage their well-being. More impactful player choices in events and dialogues.
- **Staff Simulation:** Deeper skill and specialization systems. Implement comprehensive staff needs (rest, food, recreation) and morale systems, with staff AI actively seeking to satisfy these needs. More complex training options and personality trait interactions.
- **R&D/Tech Tree:** Significantly expand the tech tree with multiple branches, advanced tiers, and more diverse unlocks. Introduce more complex R&D project management with risk/reward trade-offs.
- **ASI Management:** Develop the full ASI evolution path from Narrow AI to Mature ASI. Implement detailed player interaction mechanics for guidance, control, and monitoring. Introduce significant alignment challenges, emergent behaviors, and the full spectrum of risks and rewards associated with superintelligence.
- **Event/Narrative System:** Greatly increase the number and complexity of events. Develop branching narrative arcs based on player choices and ASI development. Introduce more characters and storylines related to factions and the impact of ASI.
- **UI/UX and Presentation:** Improve visual polish, sound design, and overall user experience.

## **V. High-Level Prototype Plan (Godot Focus)**

The prototype phase should focus on rapidly implementing and testing the absolute core gameplay loop to determine if the foundational concept is engaging. For a solo developer, keeping this initial prototype simple and focused is paramount.

### **A. Prioritizing Core Loop Mechanics for Prototyping:**

The immediate goal is to create a playable slice that demonstrates the interplay between managing a company, conducting research, and seeing an initial (very basic) outcome related to AI development.

1. **Weekly Time & Basic Finance Tick:**
   - **Godot:** Create an Autoload script named TimeManager. Use a Timer node within it, configured to emit a timeout signal periodically (e.g., every few seconds for rapid testing, later adjustable to represent a "week").
   - Create an Autoload script CompanyManager. It will store current_money and current_rp.
   - Connect TimeManager.timeout signal to a function in CompanyManager that simulates weekly income (e.g., current_money += 1000) and expenses (e.g., current_money -= base_upkeep).
   - **UI:** A simple Label node to display current_money and current_rp, updated each "week."
2. **Minimal R&D Project System:**
   - **Godot:** Define a TechData custom resource (class_name TechData extends Resource) with export var tech_name: String, export var rp_cost: int, export var weeks_to_complete: int, export var unlocks_tech_id: String (optional, for chaining).
   - Create 2-3 TechData.tres files (e.g., "BasicAI.tres", "AdvancedAlgorithms.tres").
   - In CompanyManager, have variables like active_project: TechData, project_progress_rp: int, project_progress_weeks: int.
   - **UI:** A Button to "Start Research: BasicAI." Clicking it sets CompanyManager.active_project to the loaded "BasicAI.tres".
   - Each week, if active_project is set, CompanyManager adds a fixed RP amount (e.g., 50 RP from "base research lab") to project_progress_rp and increments project_progress_weeks.
   - When project_progress_rp >= active_project.rp_cost (or project_progress_weeks >= active_project.weeks_to_complete), the project is complete. Set a flag like CompanyManager.unlocked_techs = true.
   - **UI:** Label to show current project and ProgressBar for its progress.
3. **Ultra-Basic Staff Mechanic (Single Staff):**
   - **Godot:** In CompanyManager, add has_research_staff: bool = false and staff_rp_bonus: int = 25.
   - **UI:** A Button "Hire Researcher ($500/week)". Clicking it sets has_research_staff = true and adds a weekly salary expense.
   - If has_research_staff is true, the weekly RP added to projects in CompanyManager increases by staff_rp_bonus.
   - No needs, morale, or complex skills for this prototype stage.
4. **Simplest ASI Interaction (Status Flag):**
   - **Godot:** Create an Autoload ASIManager with var asi_stage: int = 0.
   - When the final prototype tech (e.g., "ProtoAIConcept.tres") is completed in CompanyManager, it signals ASIManager (or directly calls a function) to set ASIManager.asi_stage = 1.
   - **UI:** A Label in the UI displays "ASI Status: Stage [asi_stage]".

This minimalist prototype tests the fundamental loop: earn/manage money -> fund R&D -> staff (simply) aid R&D -> unlock a tech -> see a change in ASI status. This can be built relatively quickly in Godot.

### **B. Godot Implementation Advice for Key Systems (Post-Prototype Expansion):**

As development progresses beyond the initial prototype, these Godot-centric approaches can be used for the more complex systems:

- **Faction Relationships & Diplomacy:**
  - **Data:** A FactionManager Autoload holding a dictionary for relationships: var relations = {"Player": {"FactionA": 0}, "FactionA": {"Player": 0, "FactionB": -50}}.
  - **Logic:** Diplomatic actions (implemented as functions in FactionManager or player scripts) modify these values.
  - **Communication:** Use Godot signals extensively. For example, FactionManager.emit_signal("relationship_changed", "Player", "FactionA", new_value). UI elements or other game systems can connect to this signal to react dynamically.
- **Staff AI (Behavior):**
  - **State Machines (FSM):** Good for simpler staff behaviors (Idle, Working, Resting, SatisfyingNeed).
  - **Behavior Trees (BT):** For more complex, hierarchical decision-making (e.g., staff balancing multiple needs, reacting to environmental cues, personality-driven choices). Consider Godot community assets like LimboAI or BehaviourToolkit , which provide editors and runtime for BTs. These are powerful but have a learning curve.
  - **Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP):** An advanced AI technique where agents form plans (sequences of actions) to achieve goals. Suitable if staff need to perform complex, multi-step tasks autonomously. There are Godot GOAP addons available (e.g., RodZill4's GOAP on Asset Store/GitHub ), though direct GDExtension or C# integration might be needed for performance with many agents.
- **R&D Tech Tree:**
  - **Data:** As prototyped, use TechData custom resources. Each resource can hold an export var prerequisites: Array and export var unlocks: Array (IDs of items/features unlocked).
  - **Management:** A TechTreeManager Autoload can store all TechData resources (e.g., loaded from a specific directory) and maintain a dictionary of unlocked_tech_ids: Dictionary.
  - **UI:** A GraphEdit node is well-suited for visually displaying the tech tree, with GraphNodes representing individual techs and connections showing prerequisites. Alternatively, a Tree node can provide a simpler list-based view.
- **Event/Narrative System:**
  - **Data:** EventData custom resources (trigger conditions as callable functions or parsable strings, choices, outcomes).
  - **Management:** An EventManager Autoload iterates through potential events each week, checks triggers against current game state (from other managers), and if an event fires, emits a signal like event_triggered(event_data_resource).
  - **UI:** A dedicated UI scene for displaying event text and choices.
  - **Complex Narratives:** For branching dialogues and story flow, consider **Ink integration**. godot-ink (C#) or inkgd (GDScript) allow writing narratives in the Ink language and running them in Godot. This is powerful for narrative-heavy events or sequences.

### **C. Utilizing Godot Engine Features:**

- **Signals:** The backbone for decoupled communication between game systems. Use them liberally to announce state changes or events without creating direct dependencies (e.g., CompanyManager.money_changed, R&DManager.project_completed, ASIManager.asi_stage_evolved).
- **Autoloads (Singletons):** For global manager scripts (TimeManager, CompanyManager, FactionManager, EventManager, ASIManager, SaveLoadManager). They provide easy global access but should primarily act as service providers or event buses to avoid turning them into "god objects" with excessive responsibilities and tight coupling.
- **Scene Instancing:** For all reusable UI components (e.g., a staff display card, a project progress bar, an event pop-up), and potentially for visual representations of staff or company facilities if the game includes a map view. This promotes modularity and easier UI construction.
- **Custom Resources (Resource):** As emphasized, use these as data containers for defining templates and static information for techs, staff types, faction profiles, event structures, etc. They are editor-friendly and integrate well with Godot's serialization.
- **Groups:** Useful for managing collections of similar nodes (e.g., all "StaffUI" elements that need updating when staff data changes). Call functions on all nodes in a group using get_tree().call_group().
- **GDScript 2.0:** Leverage typed GDScript for better performance, error checking, and code maintainability, which is crucial for a complex simulation.

## **VI. Efficient Development Strategies & Design Patterns for Godot**

**A. Modular Design & Reusability:**

- Decompose systems into small, loosely coupled modules (e.g., FactionDiplomacy, StaffNeedsSystem).
- Use manager autoloads for each major system.
- Create reusable component scenes/scripts (e.g., NeedsComponent).
- Use custom resources as reusable data blueprints.
- Benefits: Focused development/testing, easier debugging/refactoring, favor composition over deep inheritance.

**B. Recommended Design Patterns:**

- **State Machine:** Manage entity states (staff, projects, ASI) via enums/match or dedicated objects.
- **Observer (Signals):** Use signals for UI updates, event broadcasting, and decoupled system communication.
- **Singleton (Autoloads):** Use as service providers/event buses, not just global variables.
- **Event Bus:** Dedicated autoload for global events (e.g., week_ended).
- **Strategy Pattern:** Encapsulate AI behaviors or R&D approaches in scripts/classes.
- **Factory Pattern:** Instantiate objects from resource templates.

Emphasize Godot’s strengths (node composition, signals, resources) and keep custom patterns simple and clear.
