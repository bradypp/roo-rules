# Context7 MCP Tool Usage

- Use `resolve-library-id` first to get the correct Context7-compatible library ID (unless otherwise specified or library id is given)
- Focus documentation requests on specific topics when possible to get more relevant results
- Adjust token limits based on complexity - use higher token counts for comprehensive API references
- Before any kind of development specific planning, research or task creation always get up-to-date relevent documentation, technologies, and best practices using context7
