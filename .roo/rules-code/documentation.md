# Inline Code Documentation Guidelines

## Core Principles:

- **Explain "why", not "what"** - focus on intent and reasoning rather than obvious functionality
- **Document when helpful** - add comments for complex, avoid commenting self-explanatory code
- **Don't overdo it** - avoid commenting every line or stating the obvious
- **Use descriptive names** - good variable and function names reduce need for comments
- **Keep comments current** - update or remove outdated comments when code changes
- **Document edge cases** - explain handling of special conditions or error states

## Best Practices:

- **Use TODO comments** - mark incomplete work or future improvements clearly
- **Add context for complex algorithms** - explain the approach and why it was chosen
- **Document API contracts** - clarify expected inputs, outputs, and side effects
- **Include links to references** - cite relevant documentation, RFCs, or issue numbers
- **Write comments as complete sentences** - use proper punctuation and grammar
- **Keep comments close to code** - place explanations near the relevant implementation
- **Use consistent comment style** - follow project conventions for formatting
