# Code Documentation

- Comment when helpful - add comments for complex code, avoid commenting self-explanatory code
- Explain "why", not "what" - focus on explaining purpose & intent
- Keep comments current - update or remove outdated comments when code changes
- Document edge cases - explain handling of special conditions or error states
- Keep comments close to code - place explanations near the relevant implementation
- Use consistent comment style - follow project conventions for formatting
