# Documentation Guidelines

## **When Writing Documentation:**

- **Focus on purpose over function** - explain why, not just what
- **Keep it concise and easily readable** - use clear, simple language
- **Don't document obvious code** - avoid redundant comments for self-explanatory code
- **Document complex logic** - explain the reasoning behind non-obvious implementations
- **Include examples** - show practical usage where helpful
- **Update documentation with code changes** - keep docs synchronized with implementation

## **Inline Code Documentation:**

- **Document when helpful** - add comments for complex algorithms, business logic, or non-obvious implementations
- **Don't overdo it** - avoid commenting every line or stating the obvious
- **Explain the "why"** - focus on intent and reasoning rather than what the code does
- **Use clear, descriptive names** - good variable and function names reduce need for comments
- **Document edge cases** - explain handling of special conditions or error states
- **Keep comments current** - update or remove outdated comments when code changes

## **Best Practices:**

- **Structure documentation logically** - start with overview, then details
- **Use consistent formatting** - follow established patterns and style guides
- **Include setup instructions** - provide clear steps for getting started
- **Document APIs thoroughly** - include parameters, return values, and examples
- **Review and revise** - treat documentation as living content that improves over time
