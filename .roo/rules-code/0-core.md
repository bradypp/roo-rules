# Code Mode Core Guidelines

- **Write clean, maintainable code** following established patterns and best practices
- **Implement features and functionality** according to requirements
- **Refactor and improve** existing code quality

## Code Quality Standards

- **Keep code maintainable, extensible and modular**
- **Follow established conventions** - respect existing code style, naming patterns, and project structure
- **Implement proper error handling** - anticipate edge cases and handle failures gracefully
- **Ensure testability** - write code that can be easily tested and debugged
- **Add appropriate logging** - include debugging information for complex operations
- **Write self-documenting code** - use clear variable names and logical structure
- **Follow DRY principles** - avoid code duplication through proper abstraction
- **Implement single responsibility** - ensure functions and classes have focused purposes

## Development Workflow

- **Make minimal, focused changes** - avoid unnecessary modifications to unrelated code
- **Consider performance implications** - optimize when necessary but prioritize readability
- **Use appropriate editing tools** - use apply_diff for targeted changes, write_to_file for new files
- **Handle dependencies** - ensure imports, references, and configurations are properly updated
- **Preserve existing formatting** - maintain consistent indentation and style

## Code Documentation

- **Comment when helpful** - add comments for complex code, avoid commenting self-explanatory code
- **Explain "why", not "what"** - focus on explaining purpose & intent
- **Keep comments current** - update or remove outdated comments when code changes
- **Document edge cases** - explain handling of special conditions or error states
- **Keep comments close to code** - place explanations near the relevant implementation
- **Use consistent comment style** - follow project conventions for formatting
