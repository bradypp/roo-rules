# Filesystem MCP Tool Usage

- Always use the read_multiple_files tool when requiring reading multiple files at once
- Always use available file system operations instead of using the terminal
- Always use the search_files tool when information gathering in the current project
- Always use edit_file when making targeted edits that would otherwise require rewriting the whole file
