# Memory Bank

## Product Context

**ASI Simulation Game** is a single-player strategic management simulation where players lead a company developing Artificial Superintelligence (ASI). The game combines dark cyberpunk satire with existential tension, exploring the ethical, technological, and societal implications of creating god-like AI.

**Core Experience:**

- Manage a tech startup from garage to mega-corporation in a cyberpunk world
- Navigate complex faction dynamics with competing agendas and resources
- Guide ASI development from basic AI to potentially world-altering superintelligence
- Balance innovation, safety, profit, and human survival
- Experience emergent narratives through dynamic events and faction interactions

**Unique Value Proposition:**
Unlike traditional tycoon games, this offers intricate ASI research simulation within a living world of autonomous factions. Players don't just manage commercial aspects - they shape an evolving AI consciousness that could save or doom humanity.

**Target Experience:**

- **Psychological Horror:** From ASI's unpredictability and potential for catastrophic failure
- **Dark Satire:** Lampooning tech-bro culture and startup absurdity while building world-ending technology
- **Strategic Depth:** Complex faction relationships, resource management, and consequential decision-making
- **Existential Themes:** Consciousness, machine ethics, transhumanism, humanity's future

**Inspirations & Tone:**

- **Crusader Kings:** Character/faction depth and emergent political dynamics
- **Papers Please:** Console-based pressure decisions with moral implications
- **Game Dev Tycoon:** Strategic resource/tech management progression
- **Black Mirror:** Satirical tech-dread and philosophical implications

## System Patterns

**Architecture Philosophy:**

- **Modular Design:** Loosely coupled systems communicating via Godot signals
- **Manager Pattern:** Autoload singletons for each major system (TimeManager, CompanyManager, FactionManager, etc.)
- **Data-Driven:** Custom Resources (.tres) for static data, Dictionaries for dynamic runtime state
- **Event-Driven:** Signal-based communication prevents tight coupling between systems

**Core System Relationships:**

```
TimeManager (weekly ticks) â†’ All Managers
CompanyManager â†” FactionManager (contracts, relationships)
CompanyManager â†’ R&DManager (funding, resources)
R&DManager â†’ ASIManager (tech unlocks, capabilities)
ASIManager â†” EventManager (triggers, consequences)
StaffManager â†” All Systems (productivity effects)
```

**Key Technical Decisions:**

- **Weekly Simulation:** Turn-based progression allows complex calculations without real-time pressure
- **Resource Abstraction:** Focus on strategic decisions rather than detailed production chains
- **Custom Resources:** Editor-friendly data definition with runtime Dictionary flexibility
- **Signal Bus Pattern:** Centralized event communication for UI updates and system coordination

**Critical Implementation Paths:**

1. **Time â†’ Company â†’ R&D â†’ ASI progression pipeline**
2. **Faction relationship effects on all company operations**
3. **Staff simulation affecting all productivity metrics**
4. **Event system reacting to cumulative game state changes**

**Design Patterns Used:**

- **State Machine:** Entity states (staff, projects, ASI) via enums/match
- **Observer (Signals):** UI updates, event broadcasting, decoupled system communication
- **Singleton (Autoloads):** Service providers/event buses, not global variables
- **Strategy Pattern:** AI behaviors and R&D approaches encapsulation
- **Factory Pattern:** Object instantiation from resource templates

## Tech Context

**Primary Technology Stack:**

- **Engine:** Godot 4.4 (GDScript 2.0, improved rendering, robust node system)
- **Language:** GDScript with typing for performance and maintainability
- **Architecture:** Signal-based event system with autoload managers

**Key Godot Features Utilized:**

- **Custom Resources:** Static data templates (TechData, StaffArchetype, FactionProfile, EventDefinition)
- **Autoloads:** Global managers for persistent systems
- **Signals:** Decoupled communication between systems
- **Scene Instancing:** Reusable UI components and modular design
- **Groups:** Batch operations on similar nodes

**Data Management Strategy:**

- **Static Data:** Custom Resource (.tres) files for templates and configurations
- **Dynamic Data:** Dictionary structures for runtime state and relationships
- **Save System:** JSON serialization with versioning for compatibility
- **Persistence:** SaveLoadManager autoload orchestrating save_data()/load_data() calls

**UI Framework Approach:**

- **Layout:** Control nodes with VBox/HBox/GridContainer organization
- **Complex Displays:** Tree nodes for hierarchies, GraphEdit for tech trees
- **Interaction:** Button, LineEdit, OptionButton for user input
- **Modularity:** Reusable scene components for consistency

**Development Environment:**

- **Version Control:** Git with semantic commit messages
- **Documentation:** Markdown with Mermaid diagrams for system visualization
- **Testing Strategy:** Incremental prototype development with rapid iteration
- **Code Quality:** Typed GDScript for better debugging and performance
